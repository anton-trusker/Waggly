- Canada: Provincial variations
- Japan: Microchip + quarantine period

### 1.2 Health & Safety Requirements

**Mandatory Documentation:**
- Identification (microchip, photo, description)
- Vaccination history (all vaccines with dates)
- Medical history (conditions, surgeries, incidents)
- Medication list (current prescriptions)
- Allergy information (medications, food, environmental)
- Behavioral notes (aggression, anxiety, special needs)
- Preventive care records (flea/tick, heartworm, dental)

**Optional But Important:**

## 2. HEALTH SCORING ALGORITHM RATIONALE

### 2.1 Five-Component Model

**Why 5 components?**
- Comprehensive coverage of pet health (medical + lifestyle)
- Balanced weighting (no single factor dominates)
- Actionable insights (users know what to improve)
- Scientific foundation (veterinary best practices)

**Component Breakdown:**

1. **Preventive Care (25%)**
   - Vaccination compliance (strongest predictor of health)
   - Wellness visits (early detection of issues)
   - Dental health (often neglected, high impact)
   - Parasite prevention (common preventable diseases)

2. **Medical History (25%)**
   - Chronic conditions (ongoing management burden)
   - Emergency visits (indicates acute issues)
   - Surgeries/procedures (cumulative stress)
   - Hospitalizations (severity indicator)

3. **Lifestyle (20%)**
   - Weight management (obesity = multiple health issues)
   - Exercise level (prevention of metabolic disease)
   - Diet quality (foundation of health)
   - Behavioral health (stress, anxiety indicators)

4. **Genetic Risk (15%)**
   - Breed predispositions (genetic conditions)
   - Genetic test results (actionable insights)
   - Family history (inheritance patterns)
   - Population risk factors (breed statistics)

5. **Age-Adjusted (15%)**
   - Age-appropriate screenings (early detection)
   - Condition timing (age-relevant issues)
   - Vital sign norms (age-adjusted baselines)
   - Life stage considerations (puppy vs senior)

### 2.2 Scoring Methodology

**Scale:** 0-100 (everyone understands percentages)

**Color Coding** (derived from school grades):
- 90-100: A (Excellent) - Green
- 75-89: B/C (Good) - Teal
- 60-74: D (Fair) - Orange (warning)
- 40-59: F (Poor) - Red
- 0-39: F (Critical) - Dark Red

**Trend Indicator** (comparing to 90 days ago):
- ↑ Improving (score rising)
- → Stable (within ±5 points)
- ↓ Declining (score falling)

## 3. TRAVEL COMPLIANCE SYSTEM

### 3.1 International Requirements Framework

**Tier 1: Essential (all countries)**
- ISO 11785 microchip
- Owner identification
- Pet identification (photo, description)

**Tier 2: Travel Documentation (EU)**
- Pet passport (official)
- Rabies vaccination
- Rabies titer test
- Health certificate
- Export permit

**Tier 3: Advanced (country-specific)**
- Parasite treatment (30 days)
- Quarantine period
- Import permit
- Insurance requirements
- Specific vaccines (FeLV, FIV, etc.)

### 3.2 Compliance Calculation

```
Travel Readiness % = (Completed Items / Required Items) × 100

For each country:
1. Determine all applicable requirements
2. Check status of each (complete/in-progress/not-started)
3. Show due dates for time-sensitive items
4. Highlight any blockers
5. Calculate overall readiness %
```
