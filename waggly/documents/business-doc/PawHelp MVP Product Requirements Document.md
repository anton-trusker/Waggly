- Needs consolidated profiles and family account sharing


## 4. Use Cases

**Emergency Care Coordination**

1. User selects “Emergency Care” → receives first-aid steps.
2. System lists nearby 24/7 vets with live availability.
3. User books video consult or in-person visit; records auto-shared.

**Routine Service Discovery \& Booking**

1. User searches for “dog walking” near location.
2. Platform returns verified walkers with ratings and slots.
3. User schedules recurring appointments; receives GPS-tracked updates.

**Health Record Transfer**

1. User opens pet profile → taps “Share Records.”
2. Vet clinic invited via secure link; records delivered in 30 seconds.
3. Post-visit notes auto-sync back into platform.

## 5. Key Features (MVP Scope)

- **User \& Provider Registration**: Multi-role signup, ID verification for providers.
- **Pet Profiles \& Health Records**: Create profiles; upload vaccination and treatment history.
- **Service Marketplace**: Verified listings, ratings, distance filters.

## 6. Success Metrics

- **Acquisition**:
    - MAU growth ≥10% MoM
    - 1,000 owner registrations by month 6
    - 100 provider verifications by month 6
- **Engagement**:
    - Booking completion ≥80%
    - Average session length ≥4 minutes
    - Day-30 retention ≥50%
- **Business Performance**:
    - GMV €25,000/month by month 6
    - Average transaction value €45
    - Platform take-rate 18%


## 7. Assumptions

- European pet owners will adopt a unified digital platform for convenience.
- Sufficient independent providers exist and accept ~18% commission.
- GDPR compliance can be implemented within MVP timeline without significant UX trade-offs.
- Real-time features (video consult, GPS) perform reliably across urban networks.


## 8. Timeline

**Phase 1: Core Development (Months 1–4)**

- Architecture, registration, pet profiles, provider marketplace.
- Booking system, calendar integration, basic payment gateway.

**Phase 2: Testing \& Optimization (Months 5–6)**

- Internal QA, security audit (GDPR, PCI/DSS).
- Closed beta with 100 owners/20 providers; iterate on core flows.

**Phase 3: Pilot Launch (Months 7–9)**

- Soft launch in Amsterdam and Berlin.
- Monitor KPIs, onboard support, provider recruitment to 100+.


## 9. Stakeholders

- **Executive Sponsor (CEO)**: Business direction, funding.
- **Product Owner (CPO)**: MVP scope, roadmap.
- **Engineering Lead (CTO)**: Technical architecture, integrations.
- **UX/UI Designer**: Accessible, frictionless flows.
- **QA \& Compliance**: GDPR, security, reliability testing.
- **Operations Manager**: Provider recruitment, customer support.

**External**: Pet owners, service providers, veterinary partners, local regulators.

## 10. Known Constraints \& Dependencies

- **Regulatory**: GDPR data-residency, cross-border record transfer.
- **Technical**: Third-party API uptime (payments, maps, video).
- **Operational**: Provider network build-up in pilot regions.
- **Financial**: Seed funding required to cover 9-month MVP runway.


## Open Questions

- Which pilot regions beyond Amsterdam and Berlin maximize early traction?
- Optimal commission structure to balance provider incentives and revenue goals?
- Should emergency video consults be free or revenue-generating?
- Prioritization of “health insights” vs. deeper telemedicine integration post-MVP?


## Risks

**Regulatory Compliance Failure**

- *Risk*: GDPR breach → fines up to 4% turnover.
- *Mitigation*: Privacy-by-design, external audit, DPO oversight.

**Scalability \& Performance Issues**

- *Risk*: System downtime during peak emergency requests.
- *Mitigation*: Auto-scaling infrastructure, load testing, multi-region failover.

**Provider Supply Shortage**

- *Risk*: Insufficient verified providers reduces platform utility.
- *Mitigation*: Incentive program, partnerships with local pet-care associations.

**Market Competition Response**

- *Risk*: Established players launch similar features rapidly.
- *Mitigation*: Focus on differentiated emergency and health-record capabilities; exclusive pilot partnerships.
