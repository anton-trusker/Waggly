# PawHelp Comprehensive Product Solution Requirements Document

Before diving into technical details, this document summarises how PawHelp will become the leading European pet-care ecosystem by offering a unified, regulation-ready platform that integrates health, services, community, and commerce at scale [^5_1][^5_2].

## 1  Market Context

### 1.1  European Opportunity

Europe’s pet-care market was valued at €77.51 billion in 2024 and is forecast to exceed €121 billion by 2033, driven by 91 million pet-owning households who increasingly treat pets as family members [^5_1][^5_2].  Telemedicine, wearables, and digital marketplaces are expanding at CAGRs above 15%, reflecting a strong appetite for end-to-end digital solutions [^5_3][^5_4].  Investment momentum is equally robust, with €2.89 billion flowing into European pet-tech ventures during 2023-24 [^5_5][^5_6].  Competitors such as Rover, Pawshake, and PetBnb focus mainly on pet-sitting, leaving a market gap for a healthcare-centric, fully integrated platform [^5_7][^5_8].

### 1.2  User Pain Points

Pet owners juggle multiple apps for medical records, insurance, grooming, and travel, producing data silos that hinder proactive care [^5_9][^5_10].  Service providers struggle with fragmented booking tools, rising compliance costs, and limited analytics to scale their businesses [^5_11][^5_12].  Veterinarians face appointment backlogs and cross-border regulatory complexity, especially around telemedicine and e-prescriptions [^5_13][^5_14].  Insurers and partners lack unified APIs to verify coverage or process claims instantly, hampering customer experience [^5_6][^5_15].

## 2  Product Vision

PawHelp aims to create Europe’s most trusted one-stop ecosystem where owners, vets, service providers, and insurers collaborate seamlessly under a privacy-by-design framework [^5_16][^5_17].  The platform will deliver personalised care journeys via AI-driven insights, secure data exchange, and omni-channel services, ensuring every pet receives preventive, acute, and lifestyle support throughout its life [^5_18][^5_19].  Economic value is generated through commission-based transactions, tiered subscriptions, and high-margin value-added partnerships, balancing user affordability with strong unit economics [^5_6][^5_20].

## 3  Functional Requirements

### 3.1  Core Modules

1. User \& Role Management – GDPR-compliant registration with multi-factor authentication aligned to PSD2 SCA [^5_21][^5_22].
2. Pet Profile \& Health Records – FHIR-compatible storage of vaccinations, diagnostics, IoT telemetry, and microchip IDs for 340 million European pets [^5_2][^5_23].
3. Marketplace Booking – Real-time availability, dynamic pricing, and AI matching across sitting, walking, grooming, and training services [^5_7][^5_8].
4. Telemedicine – Video consults, asynchronous triage, prescription routing, and local regulation checks per Regulation (EU) 2019/6 [^5_14][^5_24].
5. Emergency Response – 24/7 GPS-enabled incident workflow linking owners, on-call vets, and nearby clinics for rapid interventions [^5_3][^5_18].
6. Insurance Integration – API layer for policy validation, direct-billing, and claim automation in the €7.6 billion pet-insurance segment [^5_6][^5_25].
7. Community \& Social – Forums, breed-specific groups, lost-pet alerts, and adoption listings to deepen engagement and network effects [^5_26][^5_27].

### 3.2  AI \& Analytics Features

Predictive wellness scoring leverages behavioural, biometric, and claims data to flag emerging risks up to two weeks earlier than routine check-ups [^5_18][^5_19].  Dynamic pricing optimises commissions versus provider utilisation using time-series demand signals [^5_28][^5_4].  Content-based recommendation engines surface relevant articles, products, and local events, boosting session length and retention [^5_10][^5_29].

## 4  Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1  Performance \& Scalability

The microservices stack must sustain 100 000 concurrent users with p95 API latency under 200 ms, scaling horizontally via Kubernetes-managed auto-scaling groups across EU data centres [^5_28][^5_12].  Read replicas, database sharding, and CDN distribution will handle spikes during regional holidays when booking traffic can surge 10× [^5_7][^5_1].

### 4.2  Availability \& Reliability

Service-level objectives target 99.9% monthly uptime, a 15-minute RTO, and a 5-minute RPO, using multi-zone deployments, circuit-breaker patterns, and blue-green releases [^5_12][^5_28].  Graceful degradation ensures mission-critical flows—telemedicine and emergency GPS—remain operational if ancillary modules fail [^5_12][^5_24].

### 4.3  Security \& Compliance

End-to-end AES-256 encryption protects data in transit and at rest, complemented by role-based access controls and audit logging to satisfy ISO 27001 and upcoming EU DORA resilience mandates [^5_16][^5_30].  Privacy-by-design principles include data minimisation, explicit consent, and automated deletion aligned to GDPR retention policies [^5_16][^5_17].  Payment flows incorporate 3-D Secure and tokenised SEPA direct debits to meet PSD2 SCA and PCI-DSS requirements [^5_21][^5_15].

## 5  Technical Architecture

PawHelp adopts a cloud-native, event-driven microservices architecture with the following layers [^5_12][^5_28]:

* **API Gateway** – unified ingress with SSL termination and rate-limiting.
* **Service Mesh** – mTLS, traffic routing, and observability.
* **Core Services** – Auth, Pet Profile, Booking, Payment, Messaging, Telemedicine, Emergency, Analytics, IoT Gateway.
* **Data Stores** – PostgreSQL for transactions, MongoDB for documents, InfluxDB for time-series IoT data, Redis for caching.
* **Streaming** – Kafka for asynchronous event propagation and decoupling.
* **DevOps** – CI/CD pipelines with blue-green deployments, IaC via Terraform, automated testing achieving ≥80% code coverage.

PawHelp microservices architecture overview.

## 6  Integration Ecosystem

### 6.1  Payments

Connections to Stripe, Adyen, and local APMs (iDEAL, Giropay, SOFORT) support multi-currency flows and SEPA direct debit mandates with token vaulting for recurring subscriptions [^5_21][^5_15].

### 6.2  Veterinary Systems

FHIR-based connectors sync EMR data with partner clinics, ensuring compliant medical record portability across 27 countries [^5_14][^5_23].  Prescription APIs push e-Rx details to pharmacy networks, respecting drug-class restrictions under Regulation (EU) 2024/1159 [^5_24][^5_31].

### 6.3  IoT \& Wearables

The IoT Gateway ingests telemetry from smart collars monitoring HRV, temperature, and GPS, enriching preventive-care algorithms that have already cut lost-pet incidents in Germany by 25% [^5_4][^5_18].

## 7  Security \& Privacy Controls

* **Data Governance** – tagged data catalog with automated DPIA workflows and anomaly detection [^5_16][^5_17].
* **Authentication** – OAuth 2.1 with adaptive risk scoring; mandatory hardware-backed WebAuthn for admins [^5_21][^5_22].
* **Monitoring** – SIEM feeds aggregate logs, providing real-time alerts on suspicious events to reduce MTTD below 10 minutes [^5_12][^5_30].


## 8  Financial Model \& Monetisation

By year 3 the baseline forecast targets €45 million annual revenue, distributed across three major streams [^5_20][^5_6].

| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| GDPR breach fines up to 4% revenue [^5_17] | Financial | Strong encryption, DPO oversight, quarterly audits [^5_16] |
| Veterinary licence non-compliance per market [^5_13] | Operational | Local legal entities, advisory board, geo-fenced telehealth [^5_14] |
| Platform downtime during peak season [^5_12] | Reputation | Multi-AZ failover, chaos testing, SRE runbooks [^5_28] |
| Competitive pressure from Rover’s €15 M expansion [^5_7] | Growth | Differentiate via healthcare, AI, integrated insurance [^5_5] |

## 11  Conclusion

PawHelp is positioned to capture a multi-billion-euro opportunity by fusing marketplace convenience with regulated healthcare, data-driven insight, and resilient cloud architecture [^5_1][^5_3].  By adhering to rigorous security standards, embracing privacy-by-design, and orchestrating modular microservices, the platform can achieve rapid European scale while meeting the diverse needs of owners, professionals, and partners [^5_16][^5_12].  Executing the phased roadmap will deliver sustainable revenue, defensible moats, and measurable improvements in pet wellbeing across the continent [^5_29][^5_18].

# PawHelp Platform Documentation Suite

Below you will find two deliverables that together constitute a complete high-level specification set for the PawHelp startup.

1. **General Product Functional Document** – a concise blueprint of the product vision, core modules, technical stack, and non-functional expectations.
2. **Detailed User Flows \& Use-Case Specification** – exhaustive tabular breakdowns of every flow, field, and capability required for the initial release and near-term roadmap.

Both documents have been provided as version-controlled markdown files so that cross-functional teams can comment, branch, and update as implementation progresses.

### How to Use These Files

- **Product \& Engineering** – reference the functional document for system boundaries, then drill into the flow file for user-story granularity.
- **Design \& UX** – map UI screens to the numbered steps and validation rules inside each flow.
- **QA** – derive test cases directly from the edge-case and acceptance-criteria columns.
- **Compliance \& Security** – audit the GDPR, veterinary, and PCI sections to confirm legal coverage before launch.

Together, the package gives you everything needed to move from concept to sprint planning with minimal ambiguity while remaining flexible for future iterations.
