# WAGGLI EVENT FEED: Complete Feature Analysis & Implementation Plan

**Status:** Strategic Analysis | Digital Passport → Dynamic Ecosystem Transition  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Market Context:** Pet tech market growing at 20.7% CAGR (2025-2034); 67% of European households own pets; pet social apps saw 300% user growth in 2024

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Event Feed transforms Waggli from a **static digital passport** into a **dynamic, community-driven ecosystem**. By introducing user-generated content streams segmented across health, emergencies, community, and commerce, Waggli positions itself uniquely between medical records and social networks—capturing untapped behavioral/health data while driving engagement, retention, and monetization.

**Market Opportunity:**
- Pet social apps (Petzbe, Pawmates, MyFurtopia) reaching 100K+ users with 300% growth rates
- UGC engagement: 28% higher than branded content; 6.9x more engagement than brand-generated posts
- 78% of matched pet parents arrange meetups within 30 days
- Instagram/TikTok algorithms reward community-driven, authentic content over corporate messaging

---

## PHASE 1: STRATEGIC VISION & USER BEHAVIOR

### Core Thesis: Why An Event Feed Transforms Waggli

**Current State (Digital Passport):** Static, inbound-focused
- Pet owner owns the passport
- Vet records, vaccination history, medical documents
- Limited interaction outside care events

**Future State (Event Feed):** Dynamic, outbound-focused, community-driven
- Pet owners become content creators
- Events generated by owners, volunteers, businesses, and pets themselves
- Multi-stakeholder engagement: owners ↔ vets ↔ volunteers ↔ shelters ↔ businesses
- Viral loops through sharing, comments, saves, and follow-throughs

**Unique Differentiation:**
- **Facebook/Instagram** → Generic pet content, no health context
- **TikTok** → Short form, no service monetization
- **Waggli** → Health-aware event feed + service discovery + community + marketplace
- **Data moat** → Behavioral patterns (when pets are sick, preventive care gaps, training needs) + health records = unprecedented B2B insights

## PHASE 4: TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE & DATA FLOWS

### Event Feed Data Model

```typescript
// Core Event Structure
interface WaggliEvent {
  id: string;

```

### Event Feed Algorithm (Personalization Engine)

**Ranking Signals (Weighted):**
1. **Recency (15%):** Fresher posts prioritized; exponential decay over 7 days
2. **Engagement Rate (20%):** Likes/comments/saves per impression (faster engagement boost higher)
3. **Social Graph Proximity (25%):** Posts from followed accounts, friends, or accounts similar to followed
4. **User Behavior Similarity (15%):** If user engaged with health posts, surface similar health posts
5. **Location Proximity (15%):** Events/SOS near user's home weighted higher
6. **Verification/Trust (10%):** Verified vets, shelters, established accounts boosted; new accounts slightly deprioritized

**Feed Personalization Rules:**
- SOS posts: Always surface within 2h of creation, regardless of other signals
- Health updates: Surface if user has pet of similar breed, age, health condition
- Local events: Boost if within user's preferred activity radius
- Blood donor: Boost if user registered as potential donor
- Diversity: Ensure feed contains mix of all 4 event types (not 100% health updates)

**Algorithm Implementation:**
- Real-time feed: Use PostgreSQL full-text search + Redis caching for hot posts
- Batch personalization: Daily job re-scores all events for each user
- A/B testing: Compare algorithm variants for engagement, retention, time-to-action

### Data Pipeline for Insights

**Event Stream Processing (Kafka/Supabase Realtime):**
1. New event created → Emits event creation event
2. User engages → Emits engagement event
3. Event resolved → Emits resolution event
4. All events streamed to data warehouse (BigQuery/Snowflake)

**Aggregated Analytics:**
```
-- Daily health trends
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  health_topic,
  COUNT(*) as posts,
  AVG(engagement_rate) as avg_engagement,
  AVG(EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(NOW(), pet_birthdate))) as avg_pet_age
FROM waggli_events
WHERE event_type = 'health_update'
GROUP BY date, health_topic;

-- SOS resolution metrics
SELECT 
  event_type,
  urgency_level,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (resolved_at - created_at))/3600) as avg_resolution_hours,
  COUNT(*) as total_cases
FROM waggli_events
WHERE event_type = 'sos' AND status = 'resolved'
GROUP BY urgency_level;

-- Blood donor network health
SELECT 
  location,
  blood_type,
  COUNT(DISTINCT donor_id) as registered_donors,
  COUNT(*) as donations_fulfilled,
  AVG(days_between_donations) as avg_donation_interval
FROM blood_donor_events
GROUP BY location, blood_type;
```

**B2B Insights (Anonymized for Clients):**
- **Insurance:** Aggregate health trends by breed, age, location (claim prediction)
- **Veterinary Chains:** Peak injury times, preventive care gaps, seasonal disease patterns
- **Pet Food Companies:** Nutrition topic popularity, product recommendation effectiveness
- **Training Platforms:** Training methodology effectiveness, progression timelines

| Abuse in comments | Keyword filtering; community reporting; automatic shadowban for violations |
| Privacy violations | Consent fields; never show full addresses (pin only); GDPR-compliant data retention |

### Trust & Safety Framework
- **Community Guidelines:** Clear rules on acceptable content, consequences for violation
- **Reporting System:** 1-tap report → human review within 24h
- **Transparency:** Publish moderation stats monthly (posts removed, accounts banned)

## CONCLUSION

The Event Feed transforms Waggli from a **static, transactional platform** (digital passport → vet records) into a **dynamic, community-driven ecosystem** where:

1. **Pet owners** share health journeys, build communities, discover local services
2. **Volunteers** find urgent ways to help (SOS, blood donations, events)
3. **Professionals** (vets, trainers, shelters) connect with owners, verify care, build reputation
4. **Businesses** gain access to health-aware, behavioral insights unprecedented in pet tech
5. **Insurers** access anonymized trends for risk modeling and pricing

**Competitive Positioning:**
- Facebook/Instagram: "Generic pet content" → Waggli: "Health-aware community"
- TikTok: "Short-form virality" → Waggli: "Actionable, monetizable engagement"
- Existing vet platforms: "Static records" → Waggli: "Dynamic health narrative"
- Marketplace platforms: "Fragmented services" → Waggli: "Integrated ecosystem"

**Path to Market Leadership:**
- **Months 1-3:** MVP (health journal), SOS network in 3 pilot cities
- **Months 4-6:** Blood donor network + local events → network effects
- **Months 7-12:** Expand to 10 cities, €50K+ MRR, 50K+ users
- **Year 2:** 200K+ users, €500K+ MRR, insurance partnerships
- **Year 3+:** Pan-European leader, €5M+ MRR, B2B data products, potential IPO

The Event Feed is **not a feature—it's the platform's new foundation**, turning Waggli from a care coordination tool into the **home for the global pet parent community**.
