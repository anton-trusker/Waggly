# Waggly Partnership & Ecosystem Strategy
**Building the Connected Pet Care Network**

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Status:** Strategic Framework

---

## 1. Strategy Overview

Waggly cannot win alone. We become the "Operating System" for pet care by integrating with the existing giants: **Veterinarians, Insurers, and Retailers**. 

**The Value Exchange:**
*   **We give Partners:** Structured, verified data (adherence, health history) + access to engaged users.
*   **Partners give Us:** Distribution (Vets), Revenue (Insurers/Retail), and Trust.

## 2. Veterinary Partnerships (B2B / Channel)

### 2.1 The "Connected Clinic" Program
**Goal:** Become the preferred "Patient App" for independent clinics.

**Pitch to Vets:**
*   "Your clients lose their paper records. Give them Waggly so they show up to appointments prepared."
*   "We reduce your admin time by digitizing intake forms."

**Integration Levels:**
*   **Level 1 (Referral):** Vet displays Waggly QR code at reception.
    *   *Incentive:* Vet gets dashboard view of their patients' compliance.
*   **Level 2 (Data Sync - Future):** API integration with PIMS (e.g., Boehringer Ingelheim, Covetrus).
    *   *Feature:* Auto-sync vaccines from Clinic -> App.

### 2.2 Telehealth Partners
**Goal:** 24/7 care coverage without hiring internal vets.
**Partners:** Airvet, FirstVet.
**Model:** Integrated SDK. "Chat with a Vet" button inside Waggly routing to Partner. Revenue share (10-20%).

## 3. Insurance Partnerships (Revenue)

### 3.1 The "Insure & Protect" Engine
**Goal:** Monetize the 70% of uninsured pets.

**Partners:**
*   **Agria:** Leader in Scandinavia/UK.
*   **Allianz/Petplan:** Market leaders in DACH.
*   **Lemonade:** Tech-forward challenger.

**The Mechanism:**
*   **Contextual Trigger:** "You just logged a €400 bill for Max's ear infection. An insurance policy would have covered €320 of this. Get a quote?"
*   **Data Pre-fill:** We send Breed, Age, Weight via API to generate an instant quote (0 friction).

**Commercials:**
*   **CPA:** €30-€100 per policy sold.
*   **LTV Impact:** Insured pets live longer and visit vets more (better for the ecosystem).

## 4. Retail & Brand Partnerships (Affiliates+)

### 4.1 "Prescription" Commerce
**Goal:** Turn health recommendations into commerce.

**Partners:**
*   **Zooplus / Fressnapf:** General supplies.
*   **Royal Canin / Hills:** Therapeutic Diets.

**The Workflow:**
1.  User scans Prescription for "Renal Diet Food."
2.  AI recognizes product.
3.  Waggly suggests: "Order Kidney Care Food from Zooplus - €45 (Save 10% with Waggly)."
4.  User clicks -> Buys.

### 4.2 Smart Device Ecosystem
