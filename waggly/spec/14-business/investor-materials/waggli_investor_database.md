## Key Investor Questions to Anticipate

(See separate FAQ document for full list)

**Top 5 Most Common:**
1. "Why can you succeed where others have failed in pet tech?"
   - Answer: AI moats (localization + development + conversational UI) = impossible to replicate capital efficiency

2. "What's your CAC and how will it scale?"
   - Answer: €33 blended, dominated by vet partnerships at €22 (scales as network grows)

3. "How do you prevent Rover/Chewy from copying you?"
   - Answer: (1) Subscription SaaS vs marketplace, (2) proprietary AI dataset, (3) health data lock-in, (4) first-mover AI moat

4. "Why 4-country launch? Isn't that too complex?"
   - Answer: AI localization = zero marginal cost, SEPA payments = one integration, AI support = 80% automated, proves scalability from Day 1

5. "Can AI development sustain long-term?"
   - Answer: Yes, GitHub Copilot/Cursor proven at scale. We own codebase (can transition if needed). First-mover advantage = architectural lead.
