## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 The Opportunity
The European pet care market is a €77.5 billion industry undergoing a radical transformation. With 91 million pet-owning households and a rapid shift towards "pet humanization," there is a critical gap in digital infrastructure. Pet owners currently juggle fragmented tools (paper records, booking apps, vet portals), leading to dangerous care gaps and lost health data.

### 1.2 The Waggli Solution
**Waggli** is the first **AI-Native Digital Pet Passport**. We leverage cutting-edge Conversational AI and OCR to eliminate the #1 barrier to adoption: manual data entry. By acting as the single "System of Record" for a pet's life, we connect the fragmented ecosystem of owners, vets, and service providers.

**Key Competitive Advantages:**
1.  **AI-First Architecture:** Zero-friction data entry via voice/photo (vs forms).
2.  **Automated Localization:** Simultaneous launch in 4 countries (NL, DE, BE, AT) at near-zero marginal cost.
3.  **SaaS Revenue Model:** Predictable subscription revenue from Day 1, avoiding the "marketplace cold start" trap.
4.  **Proprietary Data Asset:** Building the world's most granular pet health dataset.

### 1.3 Financial Snapshot
*   **Funding Ask:** €500K - €1M Pre-Seed.
*   **Use of Funds:** 50% Growth (UA), 30% Product (AI), 20% Ops.
