## 2. Core Subscription Model (B2C SaaS)

Waggly disrupts the market with an **"Unlimited Pets"** philosophy, monetizing *advanced features* rather than the number of animals.

*   **Strategy:** Maximizes user acquisition and data population. The "Hook" for upsells.

#### **Tier 2: PRO (€4.99/mo or €49.99/yr)**

*   **Psychological Anchor:** <€5/mo for Pro feels negligible (price of a coffee).
*   **Annual Discount:** ~16% discount drives upfront cash flow and reduces churn.
*   **Competitor Benchmark:** Undercuts per-pet pricing models (e.g., competitors charging €4/pet become expensive for 2+ pets).
