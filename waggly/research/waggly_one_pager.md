# WAGGLY - AI-Powered Digital Pet Passport  
**One-Page Investment Summary**

## The Opportunity

**Problem**: 91 million European pet-owning households rely on scattered paper records and 3-5 different platforms, creating dangerous care gaps and massive friction in pet health management.

**Market**: €121B European pet care market (5% CAGR) | 91M households, 340M pets | Pet tech growing 20.7% annually
