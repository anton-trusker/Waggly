## The Problem

**91 million European pet-owning households face three critical problems:**

1. **Scattered Health Records Create Dangerous Care Gaps**
   - Pet owners juggle 3-5 different platforms plus paper records
   - Vets can't access patient history in emergencies
   - Critical information lost when changing clinics
   - Manual tracking leads to missed vaccines and medication errors

2. **No Digital Infrastructure for Modern Pet Care**
   - 340 million pets still rely on paper passports
   - Manual data entry creates massive friction and abandonment
   - No intelligent reminders or preventive care guidance
   - Fragmented ecosystem with no single source of truth

3. **Pet Humanization Demands Better Solutions**
   - 71% of European pet owners consider pets as family members
   - €121 billion market growing 5% annually
   - 20% veterinary staffing shortage increasing wait times
   - Owners expect the same digital health tools they have for themselves

**Market Impact**: 340 million pets without comprehensive digital health management, €121B opportunity.

2. **Digital Pet Passport** - Complete health history, vaccination records, medications, vet visits
3. **Smart Notifications** - AI-powered proactive reminders and breed-specific health predictions
4. **Physical QR Pet Tags** - Metal tags linking to digital passport for emergencies

### Technology Differentiators

- **AI-Native Development**: 10x faster feature velocity, 60-70% lower costs (€340K/year savings)
