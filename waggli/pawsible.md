Prepared: January 2026
Applicant: Waggly (AI-First Pet Care Data Platform)

📋 SHORT VERSION (Copy-Paste Ready)
Problem Description (Short)
Fragmented experience – Pet owners juggle 3-5 disconnected apps, scattered paper records, and multiple services
Dangerous care gaps – Critical health information gets lost when switching vets or during emergencies
Vets lack history – Veterinarians waste time gathering health information verbally at every visit
No intelligence – Existing apps are passive record-keepers with no proactive recommendations
Single-problem apps – Every competitor solves only one thing (sitting, e-commerce, or tracking)—none solve it all
Manual entry fails – 80% of pet health apps are abandoned because typing data is too burdensome
Overwhelmed owners – Millions of pet owners experience unnecessary stress coordinating their pet's care
Problem Description – Alternative (Pet Passport Focus)
No digital pet passport exists – Pet health records remain on scattered paper documents and in different vet systems with no unified digital solution
Manual data entry burden – Existing apps require owners to type every vaccination, medication, and vet visit—leading to 80%+ abandonment rates
No proactive notifications – Owners miss critical care moments because there's no intelligent system alerting them to due vaccines, medications, or checkups
Emergency chaos – When pets face emergencies, critical health data (allergies, medications, conditions) isn't accessible to emergency vets
Zero vet integration – Pet health apps don't connect with veterinary systems, forcing owners to manually transfer information between providers
Separate apps for everything – Pet owners use different apps for health tracking, lost pet recovery, services, and community—nothing connects
Lost records when switching vets – Moving to a new vet means starting from scratch with incomplete verbal history
Problem Description – All-in-One Focus (Recommended)
The pet industry is fragmented. Every app solves just one problem—health tracking, pet sitting, shopping, lost pet recovery, or community—forcing pet owners to piece together their experience across 3-5 disconnected platforms. We're not solving a single problem. We're creating one space for everything pet-related, where all the key challenges of the market are finally addressed together.

Key Problems of the Market:

No unified platform – Pet owners manage care across multiple apps that don't talk to each other
Paper-based health records – No digital pet passport exists that works globally and connects with vets
Manual data entry – Existing apps require tedious typing, causing 80%+ abandonment
No proactive care – No intelligent notifications for vaccines, medications, or checkups
Emergency gaps – Critical health info unavailable when pets need urgent care
Disconnected vets – No integration between pet apps and veterinary systems
Isolated services – Pet sitting, grooming, training, and boarding exist on separate platforms
No community hub – Pet owners lack a unified social space to connect, share, and help each other
Blood donation chaos – No centralized network to find compatible pet blood donors in emergencies
Shelter fragmentation – Adoption seekers browse multiple sites with no unified experience
Lost pet recovery – Separate systems with no connection to health records or community alerts
Every competitor solves one piece. We solve the whole puzzle.

Why Pawsible Ventures (Short)
Strategic Alignment: We are building exactly what your thesis describes: "Technology-enabled health to shape the evolution of the pet industry."

Shared Mission: Like you, we believe pet health innovation lags behind human health. Waggly bridges this gap by bringing human-grade digital infrastructure (AI health records, interoperability) to the pet world.
Thesis Fit: Waggly sits at the intersection of your core focus areas: Consumer Platforms, Veterinary Health, and Automation. We use AI to automate the "boring" parts of pet care so owners can focus on love and wellness.
Vet Network Synergy: Your ability to help portfolio companies "co-create and validate with veterinarians" is our missing link. We have the tech; you have the vet network access to accelerate our clinic partnership pilot.
Action Bias: You are deploying capital NOW to back the next generation of animal wellness. We are launch-ready NOW with a scalable product that solves a massive, immediate pain point.
We are not just another pet app. We are the data infrastructure the future pet economy needs.

Pet owners worldwide face an overwhelming reality: managing pet care is fragmented, time-consuming, and unnecessarily stressful. Despite the deep bond between pets and their families (71% consider pets family members), there is no unified platform that brings together health management, social connection, veterinary coordination, and essential services.

Today's reality for pet owners globally:

Scattered Records, Dangerous Care Gaps
Pet health records exist across paper documents, multiple vet systems, and disconnected apps. When owners switch vets, travel internationally, or face emergencies, critical health information gets lost—creating real risks: missed vaccinations, medication conflicts, incomplete histories during emergencies.

Manual Data Entry Kills Engagement
Existing pet health apps require owners to manually type every vet visit, vaccination, and medication. This friction leads to 80%+ abandonment rates. Pet owners start with good intentions but stop tracking within weeks.

No Single Source of Truth
Pet owners currently juggle:

Paper vaccination cards and scattered documents
3-5 different apps for different services
Separate lost pet recovery systems
No connection between health data and services
No intelligent guidance or recommendations
Vets Lack Complete Patient History
Veterinarians spend 5-10 minutes per appointment gathering health history verbally. When pets see emergency vets or specialists, they start from zero—potentially dangerous in emergencies.

No Intelligence in Pet Care
Current solutions are passive record-keepers. They don't proactively alert owners to due vaccinations, recommend breed-specific screenings, or connect health data to personalized care recommendations.

Disconnected Pet Community
Pet owners lack a unified platform to connect with their local pet community—finding blood donors in emergencies, discovering shelter pets, or coordinating with trusted service providers.

High Stress, Low Support
Pet ownership should be joyful, but the mental load of tracking health, finding services, coordinating care, and worrying about emergencies creates unnecessary stress for millions of pet owners.

The Market Gap
What Exists Today	What's Missing
Rover – Pet sitting marketplace only	No health records, no vet integration
Chewy – E-commerce only	No health tracking, no services
PetDesk/11pets – Manual tracking apps	80% abandonment, no AI, no community
FirstVet – Telemedicine only	No health records, no comprehensive care
Social Media – Fragmented groups	No data, no integration, no intelligence
Every app solves one problem in isolation. No platform solves pet care comprehensively.
